In other terms, it means that on i-th test file, program took Mi MBs of memory. Initially, there is no memory allocated for your program. Before running your program on each test file, if the currently allocated memory is more than memory needed for the current test file, then there will be a deallocation of the memory to fit the current program. Also, if there is less than needed memory available, then allocation of memory will happen so as to fit the current program. e.g. Let us say that our program took 10 MBs on current test file. So, assuming if there was 12 MBs memory allocated before running the program on current test file, then there will happen a deallocation of 2 MBs. Assuming if there was 8 MBs memory allocated before running the program on current test file, then there will happen a allocation of 2 MBs.Calculate the total memory allocated for running the solution program on all the N test files.

These strings are of equal lengths, that is |A| = |B|. He wants to get some lucky string from them. For this he performs the following operations. At first he arbitrary reorders digits of A. Then he arbitrary reorders digits of B. After that he creates the string C such that its i-th digit is the maximum between the i-th digit of A and the i-th digit of B. In other words, C[i] = max{A[i], B[i]} for i from 1 to |A|. After that he removes from C all non-lucky digits saving the order of the remaining (lucky) digits. So C now becomes a lucky string. For example, if after reordering A = \"754\" and B = \"873\", then C is at first \"874\" and then it becomes \"74\".The Little Elephant wants the resulting string to be as lucky as possible. The formal definition of this is that the resulting string should be the lexicographically greatest possible string among all the strings that can be obtained from the given strings A and B by the described process.Notes|A| denotes the length of the string A.A[i] denotes the i-th digit of the string A.

The dinner is being held in long straight corridor in which people sit in a way such that they won't leave any empty space in between two consecutive persons at any given time. When a person number i arrives at the corridor, he must go and stand to the immediate right of the person numbered A[i] (if A[i] = 0, then this person just stands at the leftmost end of the line). But there is a problem, as there is no space between two consecutive persons at any given time, so for this person to sit, space must be created by moving either all the persons to left of the place to the left one step each, or all the persons to right of the place to the right one step each.  Now, Sereja is wondering about what could be the minimum number of steps people will take so as to sit in the dinner party.

You should not make any assumptions about the order in which these parallel instructions will be completed, but you can be sure that all instructions in the current step will be completed before any other instruction from the next step.

A reparenting is a pair of nodes (u,v)(u,v) (u xe2 x89 xa01u xe2 x89 xa01) of GG and the result of applying it to GG is another graph, formed as follows Take a copy of the original tree GG.In this copy, remove the edge connecting the vertex uu to its parent.Then, add a new edge between the nodes uu and vv.As an example, consider the following tree GG We wish to apply the reparenting r=(6,3)r=(6,3) to it. The resulting graph would beA reparenting rr is valid if the resulting graph is still a tree (that is, a connected graph without cycles). For the time being, Chef wants to generate only valid reparentings.Chef has already decided on the tree GG and now he just needs to pick QQ valid reparentings.

The players alternate turns and in each turn, one player is the attacker and the other is the defender. In the first turn, Chef is the attacker. The roles in each subsequent turn depend on the result of the previous turn.In each turn, the attacker chooses one of his cards and puts it on the table. The defender must either give up this turn or beat this card by choosing one of his cards with a strictly higher rank and putting it on the table. Then, the attacker must give up the turn or choose another of his cards such that its rank is equal to the rank of any card on the table, then the defender must give up or beat this card, and so on until one player gives up the turn. If both players still have cards afterwards, the game proceeds to the next turn with the following rules If the attacker gave up, all cards on the table are discarded. In the next turn, the roles of the players are swapped  the attacker becomes the defender and vice versa.If the defender gave up, he takes all cards on the table, which he can use in the subsequent turns just like the remaining cards which he did not put on the table. In the next turn, the roles are left unchanged.The game ends when at least one player does not have any cards at the start of some turn. If the attacker gave up the last turn and both players do not have any cards, a draw is announced. Otherwise, the player that ran out of cards wins.Chef and his friend want to end the game with a draw.
